- Preferences redux slice to store things like background, date/time locale preference, apps on the task bar
- Application icons
- Desktop icons
- Context menu - maybe components can add things (menu items tied to imperative methods etc.) to the event as it bubbles up and the top-level page.tsx actually renders captures that bubbled events and renders it
- Finish idb-fs (add move) and spin out into separate library - can still live here in a monorepo maybe?
